# Dog or Cat

A program that can **Understand pictures** and know the exact meaning by looking through the pixels and predict the *Correct Output*.


The Method I have used is [CNN](https://www.techtarget.com/searchenterpriseai/definition/convolutional-neural-network)- Convelutional Neural Network.


### Layers

- Convelutional

- Maxpooling 

- Flatten

- Neural Networks


These Layers are helpful to read a image by pixel by pixel extract the colourings and the arrays which have been located in the image.


### Data Augumentation

Data Augumentation has been done before Training process to increase the accuracy.
It is merely a preprocessing technique to flip or zoom in or zoom out a picture.
